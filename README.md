Created a meals folder that has a page.js file for the /meals route.
Create a share folder within the meals folder with a page.js file for the /meals/share route.
Created a community folder that has a page.js file for the /community route.
Used Link so that NextJS can effeciently link to other routes declared in the app folder, I used
Link to link the /meals, /meals/share, and /community routes.
Created a dynamic route using [] named [mealSlug] inside the meals folder since i want a slug for the route /meals/slug
Created a page.js page inside the [mealSlug] folder for the route.
Added header component in which I have a clickable logo that takes me back to the home page along with a main html element that holds two links
Used css modules to style the header and logo img so that it looks great.
